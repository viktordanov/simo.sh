This was my first React project (excluding the Postbank Calendar)- I started using React in August of 2018.

As of now it supports custom randomly generated scrambles, and soon it will support saving sessions, timing inspection and more puzzle types.

The source code for this can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fr3fou/fr3timer).
