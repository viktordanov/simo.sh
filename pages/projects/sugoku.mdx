# Introduction

Me and my friend [Viktor Danov](https://github.com/viktordanov) were doing some coding in a coffee shop and I came up with the idea that we should try to make a sudoku solver.

We began working on it almost immediately and after 2 days we managed to implement the algorithm in go.

The next goal was making a "neat GUI to better display the algorithm's inner-workings".
We decided we should try using SDL as it's cross-platform and has bindings for go.

After a couple of days of trial and error we got it to work.

_Note: the time `sugoku` takes to solve a board with the GUI is significantly slower than without one, due to the capped framerate and blocking channels_
