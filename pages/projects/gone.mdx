# The beginning

This was my introduction to Machine Learning and AI.

It started on the 6th of March 2020 with me watching some videos on youtube

- [Coding Train's Neural Network series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Y7MdSCaIfsxc561QI0U0Tb)
- [3blue1brown's Deep Learning series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

I was hooked and decided to make my own implementation in go.

# Implementation

After a long month of research, trial, error asking people algebra questions, I finally got it to work.
I successfully trained my first neural network - it taught itself how to solve the XOR problem.

After some more tweaking around (and refactoring) with gone I also managed to make the ever-so-famous digit classifier using the MNIST dataset.
I managed to squeeze 95% accuracy on [Kaggle's Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/)
