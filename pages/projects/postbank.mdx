During the SoftUni Fest â€™18, Delirium Products! managed to win 1st place at the assignment, given by Postbank.

We had to develop a mobile app calendar with Postbank's branding and colors.
This was our first time venturing into the depths of mobile development.
We decided to use `React Native` as we had used `JavaScript` before.
This was an extremely hard challange due to the fact that we had never touched any JavaScript framework / UI Library before.
After a long, **long** night, we managed to impress the judges of the competition, winning us 1st place and 1000 BGN.
This was our first competition we ever won as Delirium Products.
