I'm just an 18 year old boy that likes to code, play video games, listen to music and watch anime. I'm in the 11th grade of "MG Baba Tonka" in Ruse, Bulgaria. I've been coding since I was in the 4th grade, but have been much more involved since 2018. I'm primarily a full stack web developer but also branch out in other domains too! Some of which include Machine Learning, Image Processing, Security, Linux and others. My operating system of choice for devleopment is Arch Linux or macOS (running a Hackintosh). I love contributing to open-source projects. I also really like helping people out with coding-related problems.
