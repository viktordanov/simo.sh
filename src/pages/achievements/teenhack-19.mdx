# Introduction

This was a hackathon competition, hosted and sponsored by MG Baba Tonka, Ruse University and Networx.
The teams had 48 hours to complete an IoT project.

# Results

Thanks to this hackathon, Aumo was created.
We managed to create a 3D printed case for a `Raspberry Pi`, Backend server in `Go` and a Mobile App in `React Native`.
Due to the fact that me and Lyubo had to travel to Brussels right after the competition, we had to demo our project early in the morning.
Couple of hours later (while we were in Sofia) we received the news that we had won the **1st Place** and **1500 BGN**.
