# Introduction

English Test Generator was me and Lyubo's first ever project.
It was the kickstarter for Delirium Products.

English Test Generator is a program, which was created with the purpose of making the process of creating tests and exercises easier.
The main idea of the project is through connection to the Oxford Dictionary to extract the definition of a word, thus creating a type of an English dictionary which generates tests.
The software gives the user the option to automatically download all of the words from a given unit or a whole textbook and obtains their definitions from an online dictionary. After that process is done the program generates random and unique tasks/exercises for each test. The application is suitable for usage by both teachers and students, giving the students the option to prepare themselves for an upcoming test or just to practice what has been last learned, and for the teachers â€“ a quick and easy way to create authentic tests.
